# markdown-cv

A curriculum vitae maintained in plain text and rendered to HTML and PDF using CSS.

A fork from [elipapa/markdown-cv](https://github.com/elipapa/markdown-cv) with some style and layout changes. Also with very basic CSS responsiveness attributes added in.  

**Disclaimer: Not a CSS guy**

You can check out it [here](https://benmeller.github.io/markdown-cv/). Here is how the new layout looks:

<img src="./img/cv-narrow.png" height=500>
